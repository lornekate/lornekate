        If you have received your second COVID vaccine dose within 270 days of your arrival date in Spain, a booster is not required. 
        The timeline for this is any shot received after August 2021, depending on your date of arrival to Spain. 
        If you received your second dose prior to that you are required to have a booster shot to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before your arrival, you will have to have to complete a Passenger Locator Form. 
        The form cannot be completed until <b>48 hours</b> before your arrival in Spain. 
        If you are in a different destination at that point, please find a place with WiFi to complete the form, which can be found here <a href="https://www.spth.gob.es/" target="_blank">www.spth.gob.es</a>.

    <p>
        If you intend to travel to another country prior to your arrival in Spain please review that country's entry requirements and their requirements to enter Spain.
